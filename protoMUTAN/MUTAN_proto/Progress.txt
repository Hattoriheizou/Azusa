THINGS TO ADD:
-ROUTINES SHOULD BE ABLE TO RETURN VALUE(S)
(No idea how to implement this yet)

-BUG TRACKING CAPABILITY 
(Proposed Solution: 
  add member LINENUM for each line obj, throw exception when there is an error, use an wrapping object BugTracker to catch the exception thrown
 Comment: Instead of each object, we should point out syntactical errors using the Is___() functions, i.e. from the definition)



FIXED===================
BUG:
When creating loop block, only the last line is passed

FIXED: A problem with dummyAZUSA, the message is reset each time instead of adding to the old message
=======================


FIXED ?=================
BUG:
cond  cannot be parsed properly

FIX: Bug somehow disappeared after second testing... will reflag this bug with more info if occurs again
========================


RESOLVED================
ISSUE:
Within some of the the definitions (particularly stmts and multi), the classifier has been called.

This worries me in the sense that the formal definition of the syntax has been dividedly implemented in two places
while it should be contained in a single place for easy modification.

This issue indicates a failure in the design of the class structure.

I believe that the class structure should be redesigned and the codes re-implemented after basic functionality has been
tested

RESOLVED: Group all elements into a single MUTAN class.
========================

FIXED=================
TRY

i=0
i=1

THE INTERPRETER FAIL TO INTERPRET THE SECOND LINE

HOWEVER

i=0;i=1

WORKS FINE

REJECTED HYPOTHESIS: SOME UNKNOW CHARACTER HAS MIXED INTO THE BREAKLINE, BREAKING THE INTERPRETER

FIXED: When checking decla , the syntax analyser neglected the fact the left hand side can also be an existing ID, in that case it is further evaluable
The bug is now fixed.
=====================
