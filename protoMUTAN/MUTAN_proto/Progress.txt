FIXED=================
TRY

i=0
i=1

THE INTERPRETER FAIL TO INTERPRET THE SECOND LINE

HOWEVER

i=0;i=1

WORKS FINE

REJECTED HYPOTHESIS: SOME UNKNOW CHARACTER HAS MIXED INTO THE BREAKLINE, BREAKING THE INTERPRETER

FIXED: When checking decla , the syntax analyser neglected the fact the left hand side can also be an existing ID, in that case it is further evaluable
The bug is now fixed.
