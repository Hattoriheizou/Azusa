(中文註解進度: MUTAN object, Syntax:Parser.TryParse)

Issue:
String cannot contain quotaion marks as content (MUTAN_SyntaxAnalysis.cs Ln87)
Bug tracking for script is still very primitive.
Games and other window application exit with AZUSA, which is not desirable by users. Hence user applications should NOT be started through AZUSA but through a routine or sth.


TEST AND LOOK FOR NEW BUGS
ADD START UP SCRIPT(?)

RESOLVED==================
Issue:
Make sure that all components are ready before executing any actual commands.
Otherwise the commands that are supposed to be routed will be treated as Routines and cause error.

Make sure that when engines readline they check that the content is not NULL before doing anything substantial, otherwise disastrous error may be caused
