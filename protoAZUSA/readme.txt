protoAZUSA is an attempt to assemble the two prototypes from the side projects ,protoMUTAN and IOServer proto, into a single solution.

All basic functionality of AZUSA will be implemented. Once the framework has been tested and verified, protoAZUSA will become the basis of AZUSA kernel or the kernel itself directly.
